# üîç YOLOv8 + DeepSORT Based Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking (Jupyter Notebook)

This project demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using **YOLOv8** (from Ultralytics) and **DeepSORT** (for multi-object tracking) directly within a **Jupyter Notebook**. It uses a webcam for live feed, identifies objects, and tracks them across frames with persistent IDs.
